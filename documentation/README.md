### About Developer
Hi! I'm Handler4 from the Philippines, I'm a fan of the Metasploit framework. Metasploit framework has been one of my main inspirations in making this framework. My first time knowing about Metasploit framework was when I first started hacking. I was part of hacking group in the Philippines before, specifically, I founded Pinoy Clownsec, but we are now disbanded. When I started hacking, I have explored in the web in search for the best hacking tool to use (script kiddie days). While searching across the web, I noticed that metasploit is the most well known and so I tried. My first time using Metasploit framework, I was really amazed; it allowed me to hack other devices and have full access and control, which was really cool.

Ever since I have known Metasploit Framework, I wanted to create my own framework that is similar to it. Since I know how to code in python I attempted to create it but failed many times. Main reason of failure was lack of knowledge in coding because I was still new in the language and I'm a self taught developer.

As I practiced and learn more about coding, thankfully I was able to create my 5th successfull version. I reworked my framework many times in attempt to make it closer to metasploit, it wasn't even named terasploit. It was actually named reconsploit because I wanted to create a reconnaissance framework before, which I found pointless because recon-ng, nmap, and other known reconnaissance tools literally exist.

As I code in python, I used Routersploit Framework as my first sourcecode reference. In fact my first version of my framework which has a different name is very identical to the sourcecode of routersploit. Routersploit has a one file console containing interpreter and command functions that reaches an insane line of codes. My attempt on creating something similar to that reached 1000+ lines of codes which was really a bad idea for me, that's why I changed my coding style. I created more files with each file having its own purpose. This way, it will be easier for me to keep in track of my files, classes, and functions.

The reason why I created this framework is I want to create an exploitation framework with no specific target (eg. routersploit - embedded devices). I choosed metasploit framework as my main inspiration in making this framework because I wanted my framework to have a feature that will allow me to add modules whenever I want. I was amazed when NSA espionage tools was leaked by shadowbrokers and tutorials came out on youtube teaching how to install eternalblue on metasploit manually. Those tutorial came out when the leak was still fresh.

Despite my dislike on some of the characteristics of routersploit, Routersploit Framework is an awesome framework and is one of my inspiration as well. As routersploit is written in python, reading its sourcecode helped me in understanding complex coding. One of the best thing that I have learned in routersploit sourcecode is python descriptors and decorators. Ever since I have learned about it, coding became much easier for me.
